description: An explanation on the rationale and inner workings of generators.

Generators are responsible for generating output from option models.
They are collected and run by the [BindSightGeneratorRunner](/reference/rhomicrobindsightgenerators/bindsightgeneratorrunner/).
Generators must implement the [IBindSightGenerator](/reference/rhomicrobindsightgenerators/ibindsightgenerator/) interface.

Generators are ran in parallel, so they should not depend on each others output.
Generators may be registered via [BindSightBuilder.Generators](/reference/rhomicrobindsightservices/bindsightbuilder/#generators).

Generators for generating json schemata and a readme file are provided.
